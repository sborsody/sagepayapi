Sage Pay API for Drupal 6
=========================

This module provides an interface to Sage Pay for Drupal.

Currently only Sage Pay Form is implemented.  This module is customized for a particular client,
but I plan to expand it into a true API.

6.x-1.0
  - Final customer-specific release (hopefully)

6.x-1.0-beta4
  - Added configurable amounts
  - Added ctools dependency to billing state
  - Minor title and copy edits

6.x-1.0-beta3
  - Added better currency handling and currency format validation for user-entered amount

6.x-1.0-beta2
  - Added deposit fee and balance payoff fee "product".

6.x-1.0-beta1
  - Initial version.  Application fee was only "product".
